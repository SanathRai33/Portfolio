## About

This repository hosts the source for my personal portfolio website. It is structured so you can preview the site locally, update content (bio, projects, skills), and deploy to any static hosting provider or platform such as Vercel or Netlify.

## Demo
 
[https://your-live-demo.example.com](https://sanathrai33.github.io/Portfolio/)

Include screenshots in `assets/` or `docs/` and reference them here for a visual preview.

## Features

- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Project showcase with links and screenshots
- Skills and experience sections
- Contact form or contact links
- Easy to customize and deploy

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 (or SCSS if used)
- JavaScript (or the framework used — e.g., React / Vue / Svelte)
- Optional build tooling: Node.js, npm / yarn

## Getting started

These instructions will get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- For static HTML/CSS/JS: a modern web browser
- If the project uses a framework/build tool: Node.js >= 14 and npm or yarn

### Run locally (static)

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/SanathRai33/Portfolio.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

### Run locally (framework / Node-based)

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/SanathRai33/Portfolio.git
2. Change into the folder:
   cd Portfolio
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
4. Start the dev server:
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
5. Open the URL shown by the dev server (commonly http://localhost:3000).

### Build

Create a production build (if applicable):
npm run build
# or
yarn build

Published/production files will be in the `dist` or `build` folder depending on the setup.

## Customization

- Update text content (bio, project descriptions) in source files (e.g., `index.html` or `src/` components).
- Replace images in `assets/images` or `public/`.
- Update metadata (title, description, social meta tags) in the `<head>` section.
- Update styles in `styles/`, `src/` or the framework-specific styling files.

## Deployment

Common options:

- GitHub Pages: deploy the `main` branch or set up a `gh-pages` workflow/package.
- Vercel / Netlify: connect the repository and set the build command + publish directory (e.g., `npm run build` -> `dist`).
- Static hosts (S3, Cloudflare Pages): upload the contents of the build output.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
